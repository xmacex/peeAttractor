# peeAttractor
Because there are no more snowy winters due to climate change, I made this pee simulator

The Lorenz attractor is based on Dan Shiffman's ever wonderful stuff, and particularly his [Coding Challenge #12: The Lorenz Attractor in Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0lkz2gSsIk). Thanks Dan.

The creative inspiration, other than the Lorenz system, is the Christmas 2017 in Copenhagen. No snow, I'm not used to that.
